I am a Data Engineer and Business Intelligence Engineer at [DENSO Corporation](
https://www.denso.com/global/en/). I create a visualization system with Tableau and Snowflake to monitor project-management metrics. As well as creating visualization systems, I also have experience administrating systems with AWS technologies. Before starting at DENSO Corporation, I earned my M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering at Kyoto University in 2019 as part of the [Visualization Laboratory](http://www.viz.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp/html/en/index.html) under Prof. Koji Koyamada and my B.Eng. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Kyoto University in 2017. I am interested in people's behavior while looking at visualization and building better visualizations from empirical studies. Please feel free to reach me at *ueno.yuki.78x@kyoto-u.jp*.

Please refer to my [CV](../files/Yuki_Ueno_CV.pdf) for the latest information.
