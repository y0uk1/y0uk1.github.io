<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
  Learning data structures and algorithms is a fundamental activity in computer
  science education, but this is challenging due to their abstract and dynamic
  nature. While algorithm visualization tools have shown pedagogical benefits,
  they remain underutilized in educational settings due to creation or
  integration difficulties. We introduce Augmented Algorithm, a novel
  LLM-powered algorithm visualization tool that transforms static textbook
  pseudocode into embedded, interactive algorithm visualizations. Our web-based
  system combines computer vision with LLMs to automatically generate
  synchronized, step-by-step algorithm animations from pseudocode directly
  within scanned textbook pages. We evaluated Augmented Algorithm through
  technical evaluation, a usability study with students (N=15), and expert
  interviews with instructors (N=6). Results show that our system significantly
  reduces algorithm visualization development and access effort while enabling
  more interactive and tailored learning experiences for algorithmic concepts.

<h2>TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<p>
  This system is implemented with range of powerful tools, including React,
  Next.js, Tailwind CSS, D3.js, FastAPI, Langgraph, AWS Lambda, and Neon.
