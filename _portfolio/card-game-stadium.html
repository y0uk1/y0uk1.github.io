<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
  This is a set of card games. As of now, You can play Blackjack, Casino War,
  Speed, and Poker. In addition to these games, I'm planning to develop Texas
  Hold'em Poker and Rummy. You can play games with or without user account. If
  you don't log in, the best score is stored for each game. On the other hand,
  if you log in, you can use your wallet, so you can earn money in each game,
  and you can access to the ranking of the amount of owning money. Try to become
  a millionaire.
</p>
<h2>TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<p>
  I developed this game with TypeScript, Next.js, Phaser3, Tailwind CSS, and
  Supabase. Each game extends from the common game scene, so that I can add new
  game easily. I mainly developed Speed, Casino War, and Blackjack. I also
  developed the class design.
