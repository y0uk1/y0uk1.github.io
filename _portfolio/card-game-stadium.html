<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
  This is a collection of exciting card games that includes popular classics
  such as Blackjack, Casino War, Speed, and Poker. Our platform is constantly
  evolving, and we are working on adding even more thrilling games, such as
  Texas Hold'em Poker and Rummy, to our repertoire. Our platform offers both
  logged in and guest user options. As a guest user, you can play any of the
  games available and your best scores will be saved for each game. However, if
  you choose to create an account, you can access additional features, including
  the ability to use your wallet to earn money in each game. Our platform also
  includes a leaderboard, where you can see how you stack up against other
  players in terms of the amount of money you've earned. With persistence and
  skill, you could become a millionaire in no time. Come join us and experience
  the thrill of these classic card games!

<h2>TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<p>
  This game is implemented with range of powerful tools, including TypeScript,
  Next.js, Phaser3, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. One of the key points of our
  platform is that each game extends from a common game scene, allowing for easy
  integration of new games in the future. This streamlined development approach
  enables us to add new games quickly and efficiently. I have primarily focused
  on developing Speed, Casino War, and Blackjack. To ensure the scalability and
  maintainability of our code, we've also implemented a robust class design,
  which enables us to manage complex game logic and maintain a consistent user
  experience across all games.
