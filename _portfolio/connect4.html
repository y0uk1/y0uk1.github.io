<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
  This is a classical game in which two players alternately drop colored discs
  into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The objective of the
  game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of
  four of one's own discs. This is a simple game, but requires strategy to
  defeat your friend.

<h2>TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<p>
  This game is implemented with JavaScript, React, and Material UI. The game
  includes an artificial intelligence component, implemented using the Min-Max
  algorithm and Alpha-Beta pruning. The Min-Max algorithm is a decision-making
  algorithm that is commonly used in two-player games. It is designed to
  minimize the maximum possible loss for a worst-case scenario. In the context
  of Connect4, the algorithm helps the CPU make decisions about the best move to
  make based on the current state of the game board. Alpha-Beta pruning is a
  technique used to optimize the Min-Max algorithm by reducing the number of
  nodes that need to be evaluated. It works by cutting off branches in the
  search tree that are guaranteed to be worse than previously evaluated
  branches. By doing so, it significantly reduces the time needed to compute the
  best move. Overall, the use of these technologies and algorithms allows for an
  efficient and engaging game of Connect4 that can be played against an
  intelligent CPU opponent.
