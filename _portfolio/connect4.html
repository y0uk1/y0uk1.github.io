<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
  A game in which two players alternately drop colored discs into a
  seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The objective of the game is
  to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of
  one's own discs.
</p>
<h2>TECHNOLOGY</h2>
<p>
  We developed this game with JavaScript, React, and Material UI. The CPU was
  implemented using Min-Max Algorithm and Alpha-Beta pruning. The idea behind
  Min-Max Algorithm is minimizing the possible loss for a worst case scenario.
  Additionally, Alpha-Beta pruning was used to optimize the Min-Max Algorithm.
